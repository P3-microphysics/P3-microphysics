This respository contains modified code to interface P3-v5.1 to the CM1 model, including
modifications to the P3 code itself.

This code is expected to be used for general CM1 usage, but the focus is on the hail modeling
project, started at NCAR in September 2022, targeting a publication on the impacts of v5.1 on hail.

The "pristine" version of the P3 code was Melissa's most recent version of v5.1 as of Sept. 2022.


NOTE:  Melissa changed 'log_predictFL' to 'log_LiquidFraction' in the WRF (CM1) wrappers.
